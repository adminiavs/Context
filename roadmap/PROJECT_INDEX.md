# RAGger Project Files Index

## Project Overview
**RAGger** is a high-performance C++ application that serves as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pre-processor and local AI layer for AI-powered code analysis. The project transforms manual context gathering for AI prompts into an automated process, dramatically improving AI-assisted coding quality.
